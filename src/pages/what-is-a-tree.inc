<h2>What Is A Tree?</h2>

A tree looks simple when you take just a quick look. You might not see anything remarkable when you look at the trees in your yard, for we have begun to take them for granted. A tree is actually quite complicated and could be defined as a large woody plant with a substantial root system. These perennial woody plants are usually at least twenty feet high at maturity, although there is no set height for what a tree is and what is not. A tree also has a complicated set of secondary branches that are supported by one main stem or trunk. When you compare a tree to other plant systems, trees have a very long life span. Many trees get very tall and will live for very long periods of time.

Simply put, a tree is an organized system of branches upon a single trunk. While you might not think this is significant, if you look around at other plant structures you’ll realize that it is unique unto itself, which makes it significant. There are no other plant structures that have this organized system of roots, a trunk, and branches that continue to grow and live year after year all the while getting taller and fuller. What’s even more remarkable is that these complicated woody plant systems grow to be beautiful and even produce food and shade to other plants and animals in the area. This is no small task, it doesn’t matter how you look at it when you think about that!

A tree is a major part of our ecosystem, and has been for the last three hundred and seventy million years. A tree provides the environment with the ability to cleanse the air, oxygen, and also disperses nutrients into the air for all plants and animals to live healthy lives. Trees are responsible for all other plant life and new species that come to be, as it was the root structures of trees that first made the ground soft and pliable enough for other plants to take root. If it hadn’t been for trees, there may not be much plant life at all, if any, except in the ocean.
