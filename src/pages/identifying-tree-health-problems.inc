<h2>Identifying Tree Health Problems</h2>

Trees are much like people, they require health care, and even when they are not sick they need attention and maintenance. Trees can seem fine one day, and it seems like the next day they can look a bit odd or even downright unhealthy. Identifying tree health problems is never easy, so that is why the most advisable thing you can do is to take careful care of your trees. Even then, your trees may suffer from time to time, but if you know what to look for you can usually nurse them back to health before things go too far and you lose the tree.
<br /><br />
Tree health problems originate from two basic sources, which are biotic or living sources, and abiotic, which are non-living sources. Tree problems vary from tree to tree, area to area, and season to season but the cause will always be from one of these main areas. Pests are small animals, which may burrow into the tree roots and actually kill the tree because its root structure has been torn away, or it can be pests as simple as termites or ants. There are whole assortments of pests that can seriously threaten the health of your tree. Just taking the time to closely examine your trees every few weeks can often stop Pest infestations that damage the tree. It really doesn’t take much time at all for pests to take over and damage the health of your tree, so it’s something you need to stay on top of. Luckily, if you do stay on top of pests you’ll usually be able to see evidence of them long before they can cause permanent damage. Staying aware of how your tree looks and any pests that are moving in is the best thing that you can do to stop or limit pest damage.

Non-living sources are things such as moss, lichen, and fungi. These can often be silent killers because you may not notice them forming and then attacking your tree. If you have one tree in your yard that you know is suffering from one of these sources of tree health problems, it’s a good idea to treat all the trees in your lawn because it’s likely that they are all suffering to some extent.
