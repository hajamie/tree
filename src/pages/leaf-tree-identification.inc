<h2>Leaf Identification</h2>

Identifying a tree by its leaves can be quite simple if you are familiar with the trees in your area. Each type of tree has leaves that are unique and when you look at all the shapes and characteristics on one leaf you can easily identify the tree. Looking at other elements of the tree will also help you identify it if you get stuck between a couple different types of tree, as any fruit, bark shape and form, and even smell are usually unique to each type of tree, too.

When you are out looking at trees and wish to make leaf identification it’s true that the leaves will give you the most information about it. You’ll want to look at the leaf on both sides; you’ll need to note its shape, any odd formations, how many tips or points it has, and even the color. You’ll want to note if the leaf is one continuous leaf, of if it’s actually a leaf made up of many small blades or little leaves. Looking at the veins in the leaf will also give you some clues as to what type of tree you are looking at. The smell and the texture will also help you identify the tree, as well. So, if you can, get up close to really get a good look at the leaves so you are sure you get a true tree and leaf identification.

Another thing you’ll have to keep in mind when thinking about leaf identification is the type of trees that will grow in your area. When you know what types of trees will and will not grow in your area you can easily rule out many types of trees. Also knowing what is considered a bush and what is a tree will help in your leaf identification process. Leaf identification becomes much easier when you have knowledge of what trees are common in your area, what trees are less common, and what trees just could not be found in the environment for climate related reasons.
