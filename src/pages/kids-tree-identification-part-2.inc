The leaves of a conifer are like needles and they do not loose all of their needles at once, instead they are constantly reproducing so that when needles fall off there are more to take their place. A deciduous is a tree that looses its leaves, like a maple or oak tree. Knowing if the tree is a conifer or deciduous tree will also aid in tree identification.

Knowing what types of trees grow in your area will also help with tree identification. Get with your science teacher or a parent and discuss some of the trees that you know are common to your area, and this will help you with tree identification as well. You’ll find that some trees just aren’t in your area because of the climate, so you can rule those out as possibilities right away.

Taking a sample leaf and taking notes will help you later identify similar types of trees, and even comparing and contrasting the differences between leaves and bark of other trees that you may come across. A leaf sample from each tree you attempt to identify will also allow you to create your own field guide, and it can be a lot of fun to look at the leaves of all the places you might travel on vacations.

Buying a field guide will help you with tree identification after you have decided what type of bark the tree has, and after you’ve looked at the leaves and determined if it is a conifer or deciduous tree. You can find great tree identification field guides in the bookstore, or there are even great guides available online. Tree identification will become <br />easier and more fun if you practice, so don’t hesitate to get out there and check out the trees all around you!
