<h2>Elm Tree Identification</h2>
An elm tree is one of the trees that give the best shade even amidst the populated city setting. It can endure the pollution of the streets that's why it is a popular tree in rural cities. There are about twenty to forty species of the elm tree. This number continues to increase because hybridization of elm trees is very common and is easily achievable.

The leaves of an elm tree are deciduous. They come in an alternate position and come in two rows along the leaf's shoot. The base of its leaf is uneven and inequalateral. The leaves can either be single or double serrated. Its shape is almost oval and gets narrow as it reaches the end point of the leaf. They have asymmetric bases textured with fine bristles. One can easily distinguish the veins of an elm tree leaf because it is very prominent with a slightly rough texture. The outline or edge of its leaf is somehow saw-toothed and frayed. The spread and the length of an elm tree leaf varies according to its species but it commonly grows anywhere from ten to fifteen centimeters in length.

An elm tree's buds usually have a reddish brown color. Some buds can even have almost-black hues. Elm tree fruits are round samaras. Samaras are small, one seeded fruits. A pericarp layer surrounds it seed.

An elm tree can grow as high 100 feet tall. An elm tree's bark comes with a grayish brown hue. As the tree matures, its original color turns to ash gray with some spots of varied colors. Some elm tree species are light brown in color with whitish layers. These white layers can sometimes be spongy. Its surface is creased with an uneven texture with diagonal and intersecting ridges. Some elm trees may have a smooth texture, especially young elm trees. Some barks may have small flakes or very thick ridges. The inner barks of elm trees are known to cure sore throats and mild cough. This is the reason why most medicines may contain one or two components originating from this tree. Lumbers from elm trees are also used for making boats, dock works, coffins, furniture and floorings.
