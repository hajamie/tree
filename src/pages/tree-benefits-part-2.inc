When you look at a tree you probably wouldn’t think that it is a part of nature’s balance, but it is! Not only does it provide fruit to a good portion of animals of all types, it also provides shade, homes, and protection and these things are not to be underestimated.
<br /><br />
One of the biggest benefits of trees for people is that they provide shade. Sitting in the shade of tree on a hot summer day is one of the best comforts that nature could provide for us. Shade helps to cool us down on hot days, and it can also help keep our plants and animals cool, too. Big shade trees help with our energy costs, too. Many homeowners wouldn’t know what to do without the big shade trees that help cover their houses in shade during the hot summer months, helping to keep summer electric bills to a minimum. The shade from a tree is something that we often take for granted, but we shouldn’t!

Trees truly are amazing in all the ways that they benefit and provide for a number of plants and animal species. Without the food that trees bear and the shade that they provide our world would be vastly different. Trees are something that we should all take a little bit more notice of, whether it’s when we are caring for our lawns, or when we are enjoying the shade of the tree in our own backyard. Next time you’re sitting under your tree, take notice, and see if you can’t think of any other ways that trees benefit you.
